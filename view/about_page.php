        <h4>Support Ticket System</h4>
        <p>Quip Support adds a complete ticketing system design to allow customers to create help requests quickly and easily.</p>
        <h4>Customer Dashboard</h4>
        <p>Each customer gets a unique web page for their ticket, showing the status and history of that ticket.</p>
        <h4>Ticket Management</h4>
        <p>Tickets can be assigned to staff members to work on and all tickets have a status and track the time taken. Tickets can be marked as open or closed and all tickets are easily searchable.</p>
        <h4>Ticket Emails</h4>
        <p>Quip Support automatically sends emails when tickets are created or updated. All email content is configurable and you can even choose to send emails to your staff when a customer updates a ticket.</p>
        <h4>Audit Log</h4>
        <p>Every action relating to tickets is tracked in the Audit Log. This allows you to know the status of your tickets at all times and helps track staff performance.</p>
        <h4>Knowledge Base</h4>
        <p>A complete knowledge base system is included to allow your customers to find help themselves, saving you valuable staff costs.
            The knowledge base comes complete with article and topic management and is designed to look like the currently installed theme.</p>
        <h4>Customer Satisfaction Surveys</h4>
        <p>On ticket completion you can choose for Quip Support to send a customer satisfaction survey to the customer.
            These surveys help track your performance and allow customers to add vital feedback to help you improve your support processes.</p>
        <h4>Self Contained</h4>
        <p>The software was written in a self-contained way, meaning it won't take over your WordPress dashboard with lots of new buttons and menus. Just one new section for Quip Support contains everything you need.</p>
